To build: python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -base 4000 -keysize 200 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000 -quad_size 1000</br>  (if it fails to find the factorization you need to lower the mod_refresh parameter.. generally the bigger the number and the smaller the factor base, the lower the mod_refresh parameter has to be)

The math is working. Its mainly bottlenecking due to refreshing the modulus every 10 smooths and calling into sieve_quads... but I'm going to rework that logic when I get back from running. No point in calculating all of it if we refresh the modulus after 10 smooths (which is deteremined by the mod_refresh parameter... I'm not sure what the best value there is, I'll experiment later.. but for very big numbers when smooths become more rare, it won't matter anyway, it just slows down smaller numbers).

And when working with lists of primes there is also some tricks we can do to speed things up, since it's a unique list.

I also havn't yet implemented any tricks to gain an advantage from 2d sieving. But what I do already notice is that it is very effective at finding smooths. More so then just using one quadratic coefficient. It seems some quadratic coefficients just yield more smooths for certain moduli or something like that. Anyway... I need to optimize the code yet.

Then there is some additional stuff I want to explore... like really targeted smooth finding. I.e if we find a smooth candidate, we explicitliy go looking for factors with odd exponent in our 2d sieving setup. The math to do it is all there... I just need to figure out if it makes algorithmically sense.

If a visa can be arranged through the Chinese embassy, I am leaving this place. I know exactly what people are doing. 
Could have just apologized to my manager and paid him some money, like a year ago, and I would have been perfectly fine selling my work to the west.
But now a year later... we are in too deep, and I can't forgive this last year. I despise the west. I truely despise it. I despise belgium most of all. 

Alright, made some more fixes. There's some big bottlenecks now in construct_interval_2 (there is nothing computantionally intensive happening in that function.. I'll need to figure out why it is happening and it gets worse as we increase the factor base). The bottleneck in mod_inv I can fix now with my 2d sieving approach. Plus there is also a constants trick that can be used to enumerate those for the same modulus... which I still need to implement. Anyway... I'll push some fixes this weekend. When all is done... I'll investigate targeted smooth hunting, because that is totally possible now...  we can absolutely attempt to find smooths with similar factorizations now.. which may in theory dramatically reduce the required smooths... and if that is true... THEN.... rip rsa-1024. Maybe... we'll see. We're finishing this until the bitter end... for what microsoft did to my manager. And for what the US is doing to transgender people. Portraying transgender people as violent and mentally ill. Say that to the assholes who threatened me with gun in Redmond. I fucking hate these morrons. They know 100% what they are saying is misinformation, just like the nazis knew they were saying misinformation. There is nothing more dangerous then people hellbend on killing truth in this world. And fuck Europe. American lapdogs. Just as complicit to everything that happened this last year. It would have been so easy for anyone to just say "hey, if you succeed at factoring this amount of bits, I would be interested in buying". Instead you chase potential buyers away. Brain dead idiots. I have no patience for idiots. And the world is full of idiots. Hence I must go to the arctic to find peace, far away from fucking idiots.

I'll go work for China. Atleast they don't spread lies and misinformation about transgender people. They may not be the most progressive when it comes to lgbtq rights... but atleast they are not inciting violence and fear towards transgender people. There was so many chances for a different path... all too late. i'm not afraid of america. And fuck pete hegseth, fake wannabe macho. Fucker has probably never seen real combat in his fucking life. Fucking little pussy piece of shit.
