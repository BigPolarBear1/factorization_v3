# factorization_v3

Update 14 june: Remade this repository and moved the old one to private, as I prepare for releasing my final version this week.

Update: I will be ready to upload a much better. more final, version tomorrow. Took me some time to really narrow down the best approach. Everyone can go to hell. Screw the americans, I see what they are doing. And their fucking european lapdog friends are just as complicit. I won't forget this. There is no way, at any point in the future, I ever want any business with any western countries. You treated me without respect from the start of my career. The one person who treated me with respect you fire, blaming him of giving me a promotion. I will destroy the american cryptologic advantage, even if it is the last thing i do in my life. I swear you this. I won't ever stop. I will succeed. You made this personal.


People genuinly think im stupid, but i know exactly what is happening. The truth will come out one day. And you'll all burn 


At the end of this, the americans and europeans will be patting eachother on the back, saying what "great opsec" they had.  And then they will try their damned hardest to portray me as a villain again. Just like they have always done, for all of my career. Not ever looking at their own actions and the way they fail to show any ounce of respect. 

You know. Thinking about things, in a logical manner, you can deduce many interesting things. I for example know with very high confidence how the US always knows everything.
They tap undersea cables and satellite signals, that is well documented already. And from the landscape, because the US does not have competitive cyber talent, not in the way countries like China have, and because of the types of bugs I've seen them burn while at microsoft, which they would only do if they had better alternatives... I can only deduce that their main "thing" isn't 0days and exploits, it's a side gimmick for them.. their main thing is cryptology. I have 0 doubt they are pouring massive amounts of finances, or atleast used to, in breaking assymetric key exchange ciphers (since that leads to compromise of symmetric ciphers too, since they use PKI to establish a shared secret). Knowing everything I know about the factorization problem, and the discrete log problem... the hardness of these problems is wildly exegerated. There is little doubt left that they are attacking this problems already, rather successfully. Which makes all this even more confusing, because then they would also know that maintaining that cryptologic edge is the most important thing in the world... yet, I am being treated like absolutely fucking shit. I will succeed and I won't forget being treated like shit. This is 2 years of my life that you people robbed from me. 2 years of being broke and hopeless. I won't forget this. You are causing your own problems. Ofcourse I imagine it is much easier to just assasinate me, but your CIA are incompetent idiots too.
