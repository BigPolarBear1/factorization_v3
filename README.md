# factorization_v3

Update 14 june: Remade this repository and moved the old one to private, as I prepare for releasing my final version this week.

Update: I will be ready to upload a much better. more final, version tomorrow. Took me some time to really narrow down the best approach. Everyone can go to hell. Screw the americans, I see what they are doing. And their fucking european lapdog friends are just as complicit. I won't forget this. There is no way, at any point in the future, I ever want any business with any western countries. You treated me without respect from the start of my career. The one person who treated me with respect you fire, blaming him of giving me a promotion. I will destroy the american cryptologic advantage, even if it is the last thing i do in my life. I swear you this. I won't ever stop. I will succeed. You made this personal.
