Update 16 June:

Uploaded QSv3_036.py 

use: python3 Qsv3_036.py -keysize 120
This one massively improves the building of the iN map. Even for a factor base of 1000, it takes only a few seconds. 
Also sped up the lifting code a little by using a faster root finding method.

I am busy refactoring all the logic within the find_smooth function. I'll probably upload it somewhere the week of the 21st of July. 
I'm working on creating a single hashmap for each iN value (quadratic coefficient) which we can then use to basically build smooths. 
It's a little complicated to do it in an algorithmically sound way so I've spent the last week going over multiple iterations of refactoring.. but I think its nearly ready now, or atleast I have narrowed down the best way to do it now.

Update: Maybe I can upload tomorrow. Today was a shit day. Just thinking about the past. Reliving trauma. I miss my friends. Havnt seen them in over a year. I wouldn't want to be in the US right now anyway I guess (Canada was cool though, miss hanging out with my teamlead there), because being tall, athletic, european and transgender, I check a lot of boxes that cause people over there to harass me (I mean that I physically stand out a lot, I can't blend in somewhere, people notice me immediatly.. and standing out for someone like me is a recipe for disaster bc there is a lot of shit people in this world). I really stand out big time. I don't care as much in Europe, yes, people do stare at me all the time here.. but nobody threatens me (unless they are in a car/scooter.. but never to my face) bc in general people dont have weapons in Europe, and without weapons most of these people are scared of me. Also ever since getting threatened with a gun, I feel like I'm a walking time bomb... just having nothing to lose anymore, all the trauma... I want someone to call me a "faggot" to my face... I want to beat the shit out of a transphobe just to cope with the trauma of what happened in the US. I know that sounds fucked up... but I am really not coping well I guess. Really miss my friends. I will destroy microsoft, even if it is the last thing I do. They shouldn't have gone after my manager. They will pay for this. Until my last dying breath.

Update: I hope all my enemies die. I hope they all drop dead. I will only finish my math if all my enemies drop dead. So please whoever is manipulating me to work on math, please make all my enemies drop dead. Im not a good person, im a polar bear, and I want all my enemies to drop dead. Especially those who fired my manager. Thanks. 

Update: I didn't sleep at all last night. Just dwelling on the past. The last 2 years have been a nightmare. Unable to see my friends anymore. Unemployed living with my parents. No future. Always alone in this tiny bedroom. Sometimes when I go out to run, I need to deal with transphobic assholes shouting things. Although I do admit, it only happens every couple of months here in Belgium, not weekly like it did in Redmond.. but with my current life circumstances, when it happens, it makes it very hard to cope. Just a pariah in every aspect of my life. Just try to grind my math. Just try to keep faith that it matters, that even a single person out there cares about it. But honestly, while I like to think I'm fairly sharp, it is becoming harder and harder to know what is wishful thinking and what is fact. Odds are this industry finally achieved what it has tried for many years, to have me fade to obscurity, out of sight, because none of those people ever liked me. I don't know when i'll upload my newest PoC... it is just a really reallly bad day today. 

Update: I hope that some of the weirder stuff that has happened in the last two years. While likely just the result of stress, trauma and depression... nothing more... but I still hope it means that one day, I will succeed at my math, and that I just need to push through whatever all of this is. Its probably just bc of everything that happened, wishing there was some purpose to my life, purpose to all the insanity that happened, wishing I wasnt alone in the suffering. I just hope that one day, all these shit people will pay the price. They shouldn't have gone after my manager.  

Update: Just insomnia and depression. Cant get work done. Its hard to not dwell on the past when my current life has been reduced to this. I often wonder why getting threatened with a gun affects me this much, but I don't think it was this incident in isolation, it was everything that happened back then in just a handful of months in addition to getting treated like complete trash by microsoft and them also going after my manager out of retaliation, claiming he promoted me for no reason, portraying me as incompetent and just straight up lies like that. They are lucky they waited until I left the US, because had I still been there, I would have gotten violent, 100%. After everything that happened, yea, I would have gotten very violent. They shouldn't have gone after my manager. The only person in this fucking shit industry who actually supported and helped me rather then pointing fingers for dropping 0days like all the fucking 0 braincell infosec shitheads (yea, I still remember all your names, dont ever cross my path bc ill fucking put you on disability fuckers).

So many days of anger. This isnt who I am, but I cant help but feel this endless anger bc of everything that happened. I really hope if there is any justice in this world, all these people, they just drop dead. I really need these people to just stop existing. Bc I can't move on otherwise.

There is just something about getting harassed, threatened with a gun, and then also have the company that you worked so hard for, treat you like that right when all that shit was going on... to then also have to say goodbye to all your friends that you had known for years.. there is a rage in me that wont ever go away anymore. And I blame the fbi too, because fuck those people. The problem with spooks and feds in general is that they are really good at bullshitting. I liked my former manager, bc he always did what he said, never once did he say something and not do it. Everyone else in this world is just full of shit. Literally everyone else (except my former teamlead also I guess), is full of shit and cowardice. I am so tired of the cowardice of people and how full of shit they are. Microsoft will pay. And america will pay too, bc screw you for your legal harassment here in belgium for sending angry mails to the fbi, where were you fucking cowards when that piece of shit was coming after me with a gun? Go to hell. Pay the price. 
And I hope all my enemies drop dead. I hope they all just die. 

3 days after I was threatened with a gun, someone died in their house from a driveby shooting next to a trail I went running every day in Sammamish. I hope the people who were in that house were the people who threatened me with a gun. You live by the sword you die by the sword. I have 0 respect for these people. 0 respect and 0 sympathy. Bc these people they ruin lifes. What kind of shit culture teaches people to pull guns on unarmed people? Fucking cowards.

I know shit is about to hit the fan now, for real.
I have been working on this for 2 years. 
2 years ago, I told the msft people who were firing me that I was working on factorization (the lawyers, investigators and HR who was making the decision after my mental breakdown due getting harassed in Redmond).
Shortly after getting fired, I told the FBI many times I was working on factorization. I made it very clear to them during multiple meetings. Yet the state department failed to arrange a visa.
I had no choice return to Europe. 
Upset that I had to leave all my friends behind, that I had known for 4 years, I then for the first time, told the internet (on twitter) that I was working on factorization.
Yet, european law enforcement ended up chasing away potential buyers in europe, threatening them with sanctions for even talking to me. Which to this day, I still do not understand how you can be so dumb.
Everyone knew I was working on this. Yet no way out was given.

I simply did not have a choice. So if again, like last time, when I was forced to drop 0days due to similar circumstances, you again start demonizing me, come do it to my face... ofcourse you would piss yourselves and I would 100% punch you. Cowards.
I know how negatively this will affect my life. I just had no other choices. The only other choice I had was not working on factorization. But I fell in love with factorization, and that's the end of that.
I hope you all got what you wanted, and I hope you will all burn in hell, because I won't ever forgve this.

I know exactly what is going on. And no, nobody has told me anything, so don't get any ideas on that front, because if you go after anyone I know, you will pay, I promise you that.... I know what is going on for the same reason I know everything else. Figure it out. You people just do not seem to understand. I may have sealed my own fate, but so have all of you, by yet again treating me as a dangerous 0day dropping lunatic, who you are so eager to portray as some type of cyber-terrorist... despite all of the hard work I have done in the past, finding very serious bugs in software like secure channel and OpenSsl... after all that, this is what you people default to. I know why, I know politicians, the intel community and the tech industry absolutely despises people like me... this is why everything happened, that has happened. This is why I ended up dropping 0days in the past. This is why people fired the one person in this industry who actually helped me. Some things never change. You people sealed your own fate. You had so many chances, yet you stubbornly chose to go down this road. It is to late, and we're past the point now that things can ever be forgiven. 

Anyway, I need to finish this. Figure out a way to keep doing this fulltime. This will work... but I have this nagging feeling that this isn't what I'm "supposed" to do. There is something really deep and important here and I still can only see its shape vaguely. I really need a couple of months to just read books, study, and go back to doing "pure research"... mess around with quadratic reciprocity again, things like that... I can't describe what I am looking for, but I know I need to do it. I hope I will be alive long enough to succeed, because I know how this world works. I mean, look at all these idiots always crying about transgender people. Do you think in a world with people like that, anything good is ever going to come to someone like me? Hell, I feel bad for everyone around me. People are insane. I deeply regret how this will impact those around me. I do not wish to be around people. I hate everything about humans and the human world. I just need to do my work and finish what I'm supposed to do. I cannot explain it, but I have to succeed at any cost. And damned be those who try to get in my way.
