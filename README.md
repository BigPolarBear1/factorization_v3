I will rewrite the entire PoC this weekend. I've been learning about self-initializing quadratic sieve (using the large prime variation) ... so I am going to use that as a starting point, and begin improving it with my own findings.... I'll upload a reworked version shortly... I'm too stubborn trying to do my own thing, and sometimes its good, but sometimes it also isn't.
