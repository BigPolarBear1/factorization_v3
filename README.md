Made some more improvements to 2d sieving. The biggest bottleneck right now is constructing the 2d sieve interval.
So it is time now to optimize that. In theory instead of constructing row by row, we should be able to fill out the interval in 2d dimension. Hence having to execute a whole less code.
Additionally this would then be perfect to be further optimized with SIMD I guess.
Let me start optimizing that code.

Because each process is now responsible for a range of quadratic coefficients, the process at index 0 (which has the smallest quadratic coefficient range) will yield the most smooth. Hence I think it is better to move parallelization to the sieving process itself instead.
There is still a lot of work to do with this 2d sieving. But I am feeling extremely optimistic about this approach (it may not seem like it yet, but just wait... you will see soon! I know what I'm doing now). I should also fix the paper soon, so that once the PoC is ready I can make some noise about it. It's definitely wildly different from default SIQS.

Anyway, I'll go for a run. Figure out the math after that to optimize constructing that 2d sieving interval and then tomorrow implement it in code... and then we should slowly start seeing the true strength of this approach. This really should be many times faster then normal SIQS and not even talking about its potential to be optimized further with SIMD.

Actually let me add simd tomorrow with cython. Easy enough. :)

I jsut realized, I really can move all of the linear congruences to the initialization phase of the algorithm, out side of all the loops. Thats the beauty of working with moduli like this. A shitload can just be precomputed. And I really need to start using that as a strength. Then the heavy lifting that remains in the algorithm can be hyper optimized with things such as SIMD. Yea, this is going to be beautiful once its done. I was doing some more reading, I cant find anything similar on the public domain, I did read about lattice sieving in number field sieve, which may be similar but I'm not sure but either way, doing something similar in quadratic sieve is a good thing. I don't think default SIQS could achieve this, because they arn't working with moduli and without that reduction things get complicated very quickly... still... I really want to finish this and move back to a deeper study of some of the stuff I was doing before. It is really infuriating bc I know I am right, I know I am on to something... yet I am completely ignored. I'll wrap this up and start aggressively sharing it online I guess. It's my only hope for a better future. 

Update: Bleh, super low focus day. And tomorrow I want to attempt running marathon distance for the first time in my life. Guess I'll just take a break from work this weekend and resume on monday. If I don't die while attempting a marathon with this heat. You know, I really want to finish this v3 version asap. Hoping to be done by september so I can pivot back to v4... which is really the approach that gets me most excited.. it feels like deep space exploration, pushing off into the unknown... there is something there, a hidden monster lurking beneath the depths... I need to figure it out even if it takes the rest of my life. I don't care anymore if people laugh at my work, I'm not doing this for other people, just because I have to, for myself. I just can't let go of this anymore. It has taken over my life for over 2 years now... and it's just pulling me in more and more... and it's not because of having invested so much already... it's just that the deeper I get, the more I begin to see the outline of something amazing.. and it's still just this vague picture, I have to figure it out, I have to see it. People don't understand this, they all just think I have become psychotic and need to be in a mental hospital or something. Life is too short to waste it on things that don't matter to yourself. I rather end up homeless and broke if it means I can keep working on this. I'll work on this until my last dying breath.

Returning to Europe has been a nightmare. Absolutely nothing for me here. Doesn't even feel like I came back home... just came back to being that highschool dropout who couldn't find a job. Despite all of my achievements. I don't think I'll ever forgive people. In the last year, the only person who tried to help me was Chinese... but I guess I am too paranoid... especially since Europe is now arresting Chinese hackers... perhaps China would just arrest me out of revenge so they try to lure me there. It's just hard to know what is real in this world.. people are very good at deceiving others. And in the large scheme of things and the politics that are played out, a single human life means nothing. Ofcourse then again, I am highly paranoid, and perhaps China is the only place left in the world where talent can actually do anything. They sure seem to be living in the future already while the rest of the world is falling apart.

Anyway.... marathon day today.... guess I'll just stay in zone 2 until I hit 30k. Running 30k wasn't too bad last sunday. After that I can go zone 3, or 4 for the last 12km if my legs allow for it. Guess my plan is to go as slow as I have to, so I can run a marathon every sunday from now on without injuring myself. Once I feel more confident in my body's ability to handle those distances and increased mileage I guess I'll start pushing my time and eventually move into ultra marathon distances. I quite like the idea of just running all day long. Like Forrest Gump.

Ran a marathon today. Right at the start though, a few minutes after I left my house, some idiot shouted "fucking homo". I gave him the middle finger. I think had he stopped, I would have legit killed that man. Like, I am serious. I would have either severely wounded him or killed him. And I realize this is PTSD or something, from what happened in america, getting threatened with a gun. Some days I feel like a weakling that something lame like that fucked with my mental state that much. But I think its all of the things that happened in very quick succession around that time.. all those things together. Had I just been threatened with a gun in isolation... I probably would have just been fine after a couple of months... but microsoft treating my like trash... firing me, losing my work visa, not seeing my friends anymore bc of it... a long time friend dying a few weeks after that gun incident the day after I had dinner with him (he already had health issues.. but still) and then also someone else dying a few months later suddenly.. someone who together with the FBI had tried to find a solution (which sadly didn't work out) ... and then the persistent unemployment and getting treated like this back in europe with 0day buyers getting chased away from me... my head is in a very bad place... oh and ofcourse microsoft also firing my manager... one of the few people in this fucking shit industry who helped me, that caused a lot of grief in addition to all the other trauma. I ran a marathon today bc it's the only way I can keep it together. And next sunday I'll run a marathon again. And then I'll start running ultra marathons. And honestly, I hope during one of my runs I just drop dead. I really hope I just drop dead.

Update: Alright, got some more work done. got it all layed out so that it is ready now to be optimized with SIMD. I'll just do numpy arrays and cython.. if I cant get a considerable improvement over what I already I have, I'll just stop and move to factorization_v4... else I'll keep going here, maybe write it in C, update the paper and spread it on the internet (since nobody seems to care about my work anyway).

Anyway... it should be good... once SIMD is working I should be able to create massive 2d sieve intervals really fast. I'll be pulling smooths left and right. 

Hmm, they stopped polling my repos. Probably was just some stalkers I guess. Or dumb threat intel tech bros. 6am cant sleep. I should really finnish this work soon. I can run a marathon now, but this math journey feels like 2^1000000000000000000000000 marathons, I am very tired.

Update: Finding myself feeling especially lethargic today. Just really depressed. I just want to put on my running shoes and go running today and do nothing else. Just this hopelessness grinding away at me. You know, I know I will succeed eventually with this math, because I know I am doing everything right, even if some parts of my research are just rediscoveries of things in the public domain, I know there is enough novel stuff in there too.. and even so, the fact that I am able to independetly find these things without prior knowledge... it's a good thing. Especially since I have only been doing this for 2 years without a highschool degree and higher education. I know the process... just grind it out, longer then anyone has done before me. It's just everything else man. I havnt' seen my friends from the PNW in well over a year now. Friends I had known for many years before that. I guess the unemployment sucks too, bc there isn't much dignity in living like this. Can't even take a break and go on vacation due to having no income except from gambling on the stock market on quantum stocks now and then. But that's just about enough to buy my running gear and nutrition to keep up the high training volume (last week I did 50 miles). I have to succeed at this math, because I see something, I see something, a tiny piece and I'm trying to dig it up so I can see it completely... and I know it is worthy any sacrifice I could possibly make.. I know it is worth relentelessly pursueing it for the rest of my life.. I just feel like my mental health is getting destroyed, and it's not the math or the work, it's just everything else.


Going to have to spent a day (maybe two) working through familiarizing myself with numpy arrays in cython. Never used numpy arrays, so a lot of new stuff to learn. Quickly glancing over some tutorials, I do understand it... but there is a lot of little nuiances that I need to get right to make sure it gets optimized as SIMD. Just porting to numpy arrays alone should allow for some speed gains, then porting to SIMD I should see additional gains. This will work, I just know it... literally the only thing holding back this 2d sieving approach is constructing the 2d interval... and I 100% know I can optimize it like crazy using SIMD... because it is perfect for this. All I need to do is outperform something like msieve.. and it's game over because I'll finally have irrefutable proof about my work. I'll finally have that real tangible breakthrough in the shape of a PoC. Just got to grind it out now... running the last mile in this marathon (until I begin working on factorization_v4 and start all over again...).

Update: Just slowly learning about numpy,cython and simd. Realizing now I really need to start using numpy arrays and doing read/writes on contiguous memory. Bc when you see the bench marks for the difference in speeds... it is so much faster. It's actually quite scary... because having this second dimension by using quadratic coefficients... I don't know how to explain it... if you increase the length of your "regular" standard SIQS sieve interval (which for us is the lin_sieve_size, representing modular increments to the linear coefficient) .. if you increase that, you probably should decrease the modulus.. so that kind of negates working with larger intervals.... HOWEVER, the quadratic coefficients suffer this problem a lot less... so we can create absolutely insane massive sieve intervals... and it is scary because I can already see the consequences of this in my head. And people must know. They god damn must know about this. I know smart people must have looked at my work. They would have known. I don't understand what is happening. I feel like I'm losing my sanity, but I know I'm god damn right. Just a couple days longer.... slow grind to figure out how to implement SIMD in cython and numpy... once that is done... the dominoes will start falling very quickly. I should not wonder too much about anything outside of getting the task done.. because the moment my mind goes there, I get so much stress. 

If anyone is still reading this... good luck assholes, you'll need it and I fucking hate you all for how you forced this to go down, bc I was left with no alternatives.

Update: Messed around with numpy in cython all day, just learning what gets auto-vectorized and what doesn't. So tomorrow I should be good to start porting it to my 2d sieving approach. Then we'll find out I guess....

Update: Ended up working a little more. Finally got SIMD working to build the 2d sieve interval!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this particular step in the algorithm is so fast now, everything else is now the bottleneck. I'll have to do some refactoring tomorrow... there's a lot of shitty code with a lot of unneeded iterating and indexing through plain python lists (super slow). I'll probably be able to upload a first draft of (partially) SIMD optimized code tomorrow evening. From what I'm seeing, it should be a big improvement... and there's still a lot of optimization work to be done. Feeling in high spirits now, atleast when it comes to this. I can't see why it wouldn't have a shot at outperforming classical SIQS algorithms. The next days should tell for sure..

Update: Some more progress. Shifted the bottleneck now from constructing the 2d sieving interval to checking the interval for smooths. I'll optimize that next... I'll upload the PoC once that is done somewhere in the coming days. Building the 2d interval is many times faster now then checking it for smooths. There probably also is a bug in my formula that calculates the thresholds that I need to have a second look at.

I wont continue living like this. What kind of life is this? This is going to end one way or another. I have nothing left anymore.

Update: Seriously depressed. But the good news is, I figured out why checking my sieve interval is suddenly so slow. So once I fix that tomorrow... THEN... we should good. Sadly tomorrow I have to go to court mandated therapy for sending an angry email to the FBI (yea, fuck you for everything that happened in the US), while I admit I probably need therapy, the fact that it is forced upon me and if I don't go I can actually end up in jail (if it then goes to court) .. it's honestly just the last drop in the bucket of endless humiliations since coming back to Belgium. Anyway, it's 15km from where I live, so I'll run to and from (30km total).. so I can get a work-out in. I'll run the same route I ran my marathon on sunday, so if someone wants to assasinate me and put and end to my misery, please do so. Might just jump off a fucking bridge myself otherwise. Seriously tired.
