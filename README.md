This one massively improves the building of the iN map. Even for a factor base of 1000, it takes only a few seconds. 
Also sped up the lifting code a little by using a faster root finding method.

And I made some progress toward removing trial division. It will now only factor a smooth divided by the known factors if the log base 2 is an integer (power of 2). I tried implementing lifting for powers of 2 today, but in my honest opinion, 2 is not a real prime... and I'm not even sure if it is worth the trouble adding all these special cases just to be able to handle powers of 2. I might aswell calculate log2 to see if something factors over a factor base and then check if its log is an integer (meaning the remainder can be factored by powers of 2). I will think about this some more in the future.

Anyway, I lost a lot of time today messing with powers of two only to end up deleting all that code. But we're already close to the performance of v2. We can factor 120-bit in about 2 minutes now. 
Tomorrow I will begin refactoring ALL of that smooth finding code. The idea is really good and works really well, but my current implementation is very sloppy. I know how to fix it though and will begin working on it tomorrow. The cool thing is, that even with this code, we can now pull many smooths just one iN value (or quadratic coefficient) ... so it does work... I just need to fix that code and be smart about it.

Update: I'll rewrite the entire find_smooth function. We should just have one hashmap there for the entire iN (aka quadratic coefficient) value and then check it for smooths. That will speed things up significantly. I don't know if I'll do it today. Might jsut go for a run today and do nothing. Not feeling very focused.  I think eventually I really need to solve lifting for powers of 2 also... because then we can immediatly determine if something is smooth without having to calculate log2, which saves some cpu cycles. Ideally I'll figure out all the details in python first, because doing prototyping and refactoring in c++ is very slow.... even though python isn't a good representation of what an algorithm is capable of. There's highly optimized quadratic sieve code on github that can easily do 300 bit in c++, using every trick in the book (block lanczos etc) ... but I know my way should easily outperform that, just got to first be happy with the implemntation in python before I port to c++.

Update: Feeling depressed tonight. I know I've won already. But I wont ever feel peace. They shouldn't have fired my former manager. It's the one thing I will never be able to let go. I can count the people who have been a positive force in my life on one hand, I've had to deal with so much prejudice and exclusion in my life for being different, especially in this industry, an industry I've never really felt accepted, where I was treated as an outsider right from the start. Yet back in 2019 my former manager came all the way to Belgium to be a friend when I was really struggling. This is one injustice, you people firing him after a 27 year long career, with the most blatant lies, I cannot ever let go. This is the one thing you people really shouldn't have done. But I have a feeling you people knew very well what you were doing. You people wanted this outcome. And now you will have never ending war. I will see microsoft completely destroyed for this. There won't be anything left of that company when I'm done, I promise you this.

Update: Shit day. Really cant focus. Had to go get a package at the post office today. Just crippling anxiety going outside. There was again some car driving by extremely slowly with the passenger staring out from the passenger seat... ofcourse when that happens I always stare those people right in the eyes and look at their plates... I know this is like a stress reaction from what happened in Redmond with those assholes threatening me with a gun. But deep down a part of me wants someone to pull a gun at me again. Because unlike in Redmond, I do not want to turn my back and run away again, I want to charge right at that gun, as fast as I can and make sure one of us is going to die. I know it's trauma. This singular event that happened in 2023 after which everything fell apart. I should have just filed a police report... beccause the guy did come out his car with his gun in his hand and followed me for atleast 20 meters. I'm pretty sure even in a shit country like the US, that's highly illegal. I hope that guy is dead now. I truely hope that guy got a bullet in his fucking head. I just hate cowards like that. Pulling guns on unarmed people, acting like fucking fake gangsters. Fucking hate people like that. I swear, i am one day going to kill a piece of shit like that, some fucking gangster criminal scum.

Update: Definitely some people here who don't like me running around the city with rainbow colors and lgbtq flags on my running pack. I don't care. You know, ever since I was threatened with a gun, ever since then, I always carry a knife with me now.. and anyone touch me, I will kill them. I'm not kidding. I will fucking kill them. This is belgium, fuck off if you don't like lgbtq colors. Yea, pieces of shit.

Update: Just get agitated when people act in a threatening manner. Like was the case in Redmond non-stop. It doesn't happen nearly as much here in Belgium, but the days it does, it really grinds my gears, because to be honest, that getting threatened with a gun thing and losing everything in the months after... I have nothing left to lose. And I will tell you this, if anyone touches me, or threatens me with a weapon, I will fight to the death. I swore that I would never turn my back ever again and walk away from a fight. I don't care if they have a gun. Lets see if they have the balls to shoot me before I close the distance. Fuckers. I wish I could live in a castle, far away from any humans, my parents could live there too, and all my friends. But no fucking humans who stress me out like fucking wannabe piece of shit criminals and transphobes. Fucking shit world. I mean, look at these fucking shitheads in the US, fucking transphobes. Little men. Guess the americans spend too much time in afghanistan and now they have become like them. Fucking losers. Fucking hate all these 0 braincell people. They make me violent. 

I need to finish my PoC this weekend... its really about time to finish this now. I need to break this world, its the only way to make the future gay and woke. I'm going to make the future gay and woke and nobody can stop me. Fuck you little men. Cry more, fuckers.

I know shit is about to hit the fan now, for real.
I have been working on this for 2 years. 
2 years ago, I told the msft people who were firing me that I was working on factorization (the lawyers, investigators and HR who was making the decision after my mental breakdown due getting harassed in Redmond).
Shortly after getting fired, I told the FBI many times I was working on factorization. I made it very clear to them during multiple meetings. Yet the state department failed to arrange a visa.
I had no choice return to Europe. 
Upset that I had to leave all my friends behind, that I had known for 4 years, I then for the first time, told the internet (on twitter) that I was working on factorization.
Yet, european law enforcement ended up chasing away potential buyers in europe, threatening them with sanctions for even talking to me. Which to this day, I still do not understand how you can be so dumb.
Everyone knew I was working on this. Yet no way out was given.

I simply did not have a choice. So if again, like last time, when I was forced to drop 0days due to similar circumstances, you again start demonizing me, come do it to my face... ofcourse you would piss yourselves and I would 100% punch you. Cowards.
I know how negatively this will affect my life. I just had no other choices. The only other choice I had was not working on factorization. But I fell in love with factorization, and that's the end of that.
I hope you all got what you wanted, and I hope you will all burn in hell, because I won't ever forgve this.

I know exactly what is going on. And no, nobody has told me anything, so don't get any ideas on that front, because if you go after anyone I know, you will pay, I promise you that.... I know what is going on for the same reason I know everything else. Figure it out. You people just do not seem to understand. I may have sealed my own fate, but so have all of you, by yet again treating me as a dangerous 0day dropping lunatic, who you are so eager to portray as some type of cyber-terrorist... despite all of the hard work I have done in the past, finding very serious bugs in software like secure channel and OpenSsl... after all that, this is what you people default to. I know why, I know politicians, the intel community and the tech industry absolutely despises people like me... this is why everything happened, that has happened. This is why I ended up dropping 0days in the past. This is why people fired the one person in this industry who actually helped me. Some things never change. You people sealed your own fate. You had so many chances, yet you stubbornly chose to go down this road. It is to late, and we're past the point now that things can ever be forgiven. 

Anyway, I need to finish this. Figure out a way to keep doing this fulltime. This will work... but I have this nagging feeling that this isn't what I'm "supposed" to do. There is something really deep and important here and I still can only see its shape vaguely. I really need a couple of months to just read books, study, and go back to doing "pure research"... mess around with quadratic reciprocity again, things like that... I can't describe what I am looking for, but I know I need to do it. I hope I will be alive long enough to succeed, because I know how this world works. I mean, look at all these idiots always crying about transgender people. Do you think in a world with people like that, anything good is ever going to come to someone like me? Hell, I feel bad for everyone around me. People are insane. I deeply regret how this will impact those around me. I do not wish to be around people. I hate everything about humans and the human world. I just need to do my work and finish what I'm supposed to do. I cannot explain it, but I have to succeed at any cost. And damned be those who try to get in my way.
