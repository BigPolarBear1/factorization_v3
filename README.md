Note: I know I am right. I know people know I am right. I know how you people treat me, despite being right. I do not care about the reasons. I will not forgive you people for stealing more then a year from my life where I had to struggle like this. I especially wont forgive belgium. I would renounce my citizenship and move elsewhere for this. I cannot ever forgive this. I've been broke for a year, I can't find work, I can't find 0day buyers, I can't see my friends anymore and I'm stuck, there is no dignity in living like this. A human life is very short, and you have wasted a good chunk of mine. There absolutely won't be forgiveness. We're past that now. And if I get the oppurtunity to work in Asia, I will go and there is absolutely nothing that can be changed about that. Because what you people are doing, I have no words for it, this is betrayal. Betrayal to the long career I had, helping find security issues in software like OpenSsl and other very important components.. you better hope this was my last discovery because next time I will remember who treated me like shit and who didn't. Remember that. The only way I may even remotely change my mind is if Microsoft publically apologizes to my former manager and pays him many millions. Without that, forget it, you'll have to kill me I guess.

Disclaimer about v3: My main goal for this version is to outperform standard SIQS by being able to quickly precalculate what is in SIQS the roots of the polynomials (but here are coefficients mod m). In theory being able to solve that bottleneck should allow us to outperform standard SIQS. And once I am able to proof this with a PoC, I hope to make some noise about it and find a way to get funded for v4, and I don't care if that means moving to Asia. I'll do whatever it takes to work on this. Sure as hell have not been gettig respect here in the west.

The PoC is still very unoptimized... lets see how far we can push it. Msieve will really struggle around 350-bit (a highly optimized SIQS PoC), so we need to push beyond that to be succesful.

Currently this only works with 1 worker. I have gutted the worker support to better be able to profile the code. Will fix later.

The more I started thinking about SIMD, the more I realized how wrong my approach was. If its only 256-bit writes, you only get an advantage if the data you are writing is spaced very close together (so you're not just writing a bunch of zeroes).
I removed it, and it sped up everything a lot. I need to actually do some reading on how to implement SIMD for sieve intervals. That seems to be an entirely independent research topic.

Anyway, by far the biggest bottleneck is now the linear congruences (you will see if you profile the script, it's so bad now that it takes double the time of trial division in factorise_fast). But there is a well documented trick to massively speed that up. So I'll implement that next. Then we should be near the final shape of the algorithm.
What remains after that will be fixing indexing so we dont call into get_item() due to python abstractions. And adding static typing everywhere.
Once I'm happy with the mainloop, I'll shift my efforts to the precomputational part (I have barely touched that part so far, so there's lots of room for improvement there), since that is the strength of my findings, being able to shift all the burden there. Also wonder if I can apply that linear congruence trick to computing the iN map.. that would be amazing.. since that linear congruence is the biggest bottleneck there. Then there is no limit the the size of factor bases we can precompute... and then I would definitely feel vindicated about my work. In addition it needs to be placed in contiguous memory to save RAM.

I'll solve the linear congruence bottleneck on Monday, its actually the biggest bottleneck now but there's a very well documented trick for it using constants... I'm hoping that not having to recalculate roots for my polynomials like SIQS is forced to do inside their mainloop will allow me to overtake msieve's performance.. but I have to do everything right.. cant just do stupid shit like I was doing with the SIMD stuff anyway going to run 50k now. 

Update: Ran 50k, but embarrassingly slow. Decided to swap out my good running shoes for really flat cheap trail running shoes bc it was a little rainy and muddy... but when you run 50k in the woods, you really need to run with good shoes that fit well.. big big big mistake.. I'll keep running 50k for a few sundays and once I can do it easily I'll start increasing the distance again.. also I should buy a water filter and some purification tablets so I can drink water from Belgian swamps lol... I don't know how else to solve it. I had 3liters of drinks with me today... but ran out near the end, and was so thirsty because I was sweating so much in this humid weather. 
Anyway, let me start reading about this linear congruence trick to understand how that exactly is supposed to work. As long as I can precompute large factor bases quickly.. it should be an improvement over SIQS, since we basically deleted a very big bottleneck, but I won't know for sure until I fully optimize a PoC.... that is the only path to truth for me. And if I fail.. I wouldn't know what to do after that.

Update2: I just realized that where SIQS has to use tonelli, we are now using linear congruence (we dont use tonelli at all in the algorithm)...and I can apply that linear congruence trick in multiple places and hyper optimize the entire thing! HAH! Check mate. Lets see tomorrow.

Just extremely depressed. The energy it has taken to keep going for 2 years after everything that has happened and the persistent hopelessness. And there is always this chance that I have completely missed the mark. That I'm completely wrong. Hammering on all the wrong things just running in circles. What else am I supposed to do then? Do another herculean effort to pivot back to 0days, after pushing myself for this long? I need a vacation but I'm broke. I guess next week as I optimise the rest will reveal the truth... just all the trauma of what happened in the US that made me do this for 2 years. Its a pure trauma reaction. Just escaping into all this math. This world makes me sick. I want to be alone in the arctic.

Update: Hmmpf, there is a bunch of tricks I should probably apply. Anyway, linear congruences first.. I know that can easily be optimized to the point it is negilible. Just depressed. Living like this.. I  miss my former manager. I was respected and supported in every way. My managers never misgendered me. They always treated me with the most respect. Sometimes when I'm outside running and I hear people saying shitty things (people really dont want trans people visible in public) it just really makes me miss those moments. Microsoft has taken everything away from me. And not just from me, they also went after my manager.

Update: Alright, lets figure out how this trick for fast linear congruences works today. If I can implement that without much overhead, then my PoC would be really fast. There is no tonelli in my PoC, there is only linear congruences. It would speed up everything. From precalculating my factor base to the mainloop. It will be incredibly fast. We will definitely get above 300 bit once this is fixed, if we can implement it in a reasonable way. And then it is just optimizing all the other things to push beyond what SIQS is capable of. Trying to be optimistic.. I have to be. I have to relentlessly believe that this will work. Otherwise all that would remain is despair and hopelessness. 

Guys, if linear congruences, while profiling the main loop takes twice as long as trial division to check smooth candidates, plus it is also the main bottleneck in precalculating the factor base. Do you realize what speeds I will get if I can solve that bottleneck? Guess somewhere in the next few days, we will be opening that door and "finding out". Hope you are all ready. I won't forgive the west for this last year. I know what you people did. After everything I had done in my career. No way. Atleast the Chinese tried to help me this last year, I'm just a fucking fool bc I'm too scared to just get on a plane and go to China. Ofcourse Europe arresting Chinese hackers because they are american lapdogs doens't help with the paranoia of just flying to China and hoping they won't just arrest me so they can trade me for their Chinese hackers.  Because that's just the level of paranoid that I am. It is funny, because you people manufactured this situation yourself and I have no doubt people now try to justify this last year by calling me a cyber terrorist. In case I succeed, I would be very careful with what you say and do, because it wouldn't take much for me to go take my chances in China. And I'm nowhere near done with my work. This right here, is not what I'm really trying to do. I will push beyond this. I'll break every PKI scheme that has ever existed, I'll figure it out somehow, by determination alone.

I think people often also just harass me and shout things at me from their car because I'm trans, but I'm also like 88kg, 6'1... and I run marathons and now ultra marathons (50k), I ran 380km in the last month. And people who are like anti-trans, they are really afraid of someone like me. I scare them to death. When I'm out running, I often see people looking at me like really afraid and nervous (it happens all the time when I'm just out running). And I think that's why I always have to non-stop deal with shit like that and why I got threatened with a gun in Redmond. Because nobody is going to threaten my physically unless they are with a large group of people and/or have weapons. I don't mind my size, because I am a bear. I'm proud of my size and athletic abilities. It's a big part of who I am. It's just the trauma... like I am legit afraid I am going to kill someone if they threaten my physical safety again like those guys in Redmond, or really get in my face shouting slurs at me. I literally feel like a bear. I do not want to interact with humans. I would rather be somewhere without humans at all, but a bear will also maul a human to death if it's threatened by one. I am really not coping with the trauma. I'm no pushover.. I don't get traumatized that easily.. it's just everything that happened together in 2023/2024, and most of all, being seperated from all my friends because of what microsoft did. It didn't just ruin my life, it ruined my mental health and it ruined my sense of safety. I literally just really want to be alone in the arctic right now so I can know some piece of mind and not have to struggle with this hypervigilance day in day out.
