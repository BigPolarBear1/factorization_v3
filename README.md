Note: I am now finding myself doing functionally the same as SIQS with just more overhead to calculate the factor_base. Which is not good. I will explore the 2d sieving part again and also lifting, but I need to move away to v4 asap, bc I'm burning too much time here.

I'm so depressed. 

To get any strength out of this number theory compared to normal SIQS, you need to achieve 2d sieving. Without that it is pointless, then you just end up doing slower SIQS. 
Looking at this stack overflow PoC, seeing this trick they do to enumerate root values for multiple linear coefficients within the same quadratic coefficient... I think I can do the same by enumerating quadratic coefficients within a modulus.  I think some approach like that is how you succesfully do 2d sieving. Let me bash my head against that today.

I'm so awfully depressed. Today is really bad. Having a lot of suicidal thoughts. 

That is it. If you know one quadratic coefficient in mod m, then you can very quickly calculate all the other ones with no overhead.
And we can very quickly calculate its linear coefficients with little to no overhead. 
And that is how you construct your 2d sieve interval with little to no overhead. 
I mean, the math is all there and that stack overflow PoC shows me how to do those calculations. 

Ok, 2d sieving or death. Lets make it happen. One final effort. 

Update: So i've added the trick to very quickly calculating linear coefficient enumerations using precalculated constants. Then we can do the same to get the dist1 and dist2 variables for creating the sieve interval... but using purely coefficients that looks a little different.. I think it uses different constant based on the legendre symbol... I need to manually run the numbers to figure out what the constants should be. That, I hope to finish today. 

Then tomorrow I will try to port that same trick to quadratic coefficients.... and somehow get the math right to quickly perform 2d sieving in a way that actually gives us an advantage, if it all possible. I'm struggling with brain fog due to depression a lot.. have been for some months. Life is not great.

My initial intuition and appraoch with the residue map wasn't bad. But I need to work with one single modulus. This how you can apply a lot of cool tricks. And I need to actually think about the design careful. Like pen and paper, and try to not be depressed and find some creativity. 2d sieving. I know it can be done. Constructing all permutations of quadratic coefficients using that precomputed constants trick is easy, no overhead there. Then every generated quadratic coefficient will have a unique pair of linear coefficients mod p. Here we apply the same constants trick again to generate all permutations without overhead. For the distances in the sieve interval mod p, we again use that constants trick to enumerate them.. I nearly have that math figured out in code... just one bug I need to fix tomorrow... and we can save the "seen" residues mod p and re-use them if we hit the same residue again. But without precomputing residues like we did before that's too slow.... just do it all on the fly. Sounds good... time to get too work. Almost 2.5 years ago when I started with 0 math knowledge, as a highschool dropout.. I do not care what people think. 2.5 years is still less time spent on math then the average undergraduate. I will keep pushing, I will never give up. Even if I decide to go slower to make some money in the future, I will keep working on this. I will run out the clock, and eventually I will succeed. I may not be as smart and sharp as some people, but I have determination, creativity and trauma... hahahaha. As long as I'm making progress, as long as I still have ideas, why would I stop? Life is short, I have one chance to do something truely unique, and I'm crazy enough to give it a try at the cost of everything else. I don't care about the rest.

Update: Yea, I need to zero in on 2d sieving for now. I have a bunch of other ideas, but they will take a lot of further research. I also see some connection to number field sieve's approach... but again... I need time and I'm depressed, I need something tangible asap.. so 2d sieving... lets go.

Update: Made some more progress toward 2d sieving. So you can't just enumerate possible quadratic coefficients mod m. You need to sieve them within a range (i.e 1 - 1000000), and only proceed if all the modulus primes are found. However, this will still yield many many many many quadratic coefficients, quickly, so that's not an issue at all. Eventually that will save us a whole lot of modular inverse calls... but I wonder where else I can gain advantages. Another advantage with working with just one modulus for longer is that we'll have a lot more similar factors in our results.... does that mean I need less smooths to be successful? All things I'll need to test. Anyway, time for a run. Always got to run. No matter how shit everything is. If I stop running, depression has won. 

Update: OOOH. You know with this 2d sieving, we can basically just use a single modulus for the entire run easily. I wonder if that is what would allow me to bridge the gap over to number field sieve when all our smooth are constructed using coefficients from the same modulus... I'll need to check that once I'm done. That would open up an entirely new world for me to explore.

Bah when I finished running I heard someone saying to his wife "look at that faggot" (but in dutch), then I kept staring at him as he passed me to see if he would dare say anything. And after that, I decided to run some more and ran right passed the guy (but like really close to make him afraid on purpose). If he had insulted me to my face, I would have killed him. Simple as that. I am not coping well with the trauma of what happened in the US and how I'm treated here in Belgium. Every day I think about ending my life. And I really just want those events from the US to repeat again, someone shouting slurs at me or pulling a weapon on me. I don't want to turn my back again. I want one last final battle on this piece of shit world. Fuck it all.
Ah man, today is not a good day. I feel like I'm about to have a nervous breakdown again. Just this shit man. I can't cope with this non-stop hypervigilance all the time anymore. The city where I live, its not a gay/queer friendly place. There is a lot of very religious people here. They do not want to see a trans person with a rainbow flag on their running kit running outside all the time in their neighbourhood. I know how it is. And I want those people to provoke me, to give me an excuse. I want to events from the US to happen again. And I don't want to turn my back again when it happens. I don't care if someone dies.

Shit day. Guess thats to be expected when I nearly killed someone. One day someone is going to provoke me and all hell will break loose. And fuck it all. I'm ready to die. My life ended two years ago. 

its funny, also like those stalkers who had been harassing me online for 7+ years. it's funny how the internet makes these people feel safe, because if I ever see them in real life. I will straight up kill them without second thought. Before 2 years ago, I wasn't violent. But after everything that has happened. Yea. I'm living the final years of my life now. I have accepted my death already.

really man. belgium is just a fucking narco state. fucking hate this shit country. i despise belgium deeply. Europe in general. My entire life in europe has been a complete fucking nightmare. atleast in canada, i got to live with some dignity for a few years. Fuck europe. I should just move to russia or something. Shame they are homophobic and transphobic, would have loved the cold weather otherwise. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. It's all been completely ruined. I'm just looking for an excuse to end it lately. Be it one final violent act, taking some piece of shit transphobes to the afterlife with me here in belgium, or alone in the woods, hanging on a tree, I don't care anymore. Fuck it all. I truely despise this world. I really really despise this world. The one time in my life there was light and grace, shitheads destroyed it all, and they even came after my manager. This will all end soon. One way or another.

I should just go find one of those famous belgian drug dealers, and murder them in the street, fucking despise drug dealers and gangsters. Honestly probably one of the only things I agree with with the US currently, having lost a friend at young age to overdose. Shame their are fucking transphobes just like russia. Despise europe. I hate this place. I need to get out of here. Where the fuck do I even go anymore? Seems Asia is the only option left. Atleast they have shown interesting in wanting me there.. unlike literally everywhere else in the world.

My entire life, I pushed myself to my limits. With everything I do. I gave it my everything. For what? To be 35 living with my parents, no savings, nothing, can't even find a job, getting insulted on the street by some fuckers (who are probably some narco pieces of shit, bc thats all belgium is). I'm going to end my life. I have decided. I just don't know how yet. Ideally I'll find some drug dealers to take to the grave with me. Bc these people killed my friend when I was young. Why do good people die when fucking scum of the earth rules this world? Everything good in this world gets destroyed. Fucking shit world.

I wish I wasn't broke. It's not the first time I've felt mentally in this place. It's usually a good indicator I need to go be alone in nature. And right now what I need is a month long winter expedition in the arctic. I don't care if I freeze to death or get burried in an avalanche. I just want to not be here right now, not be around humans. I can't fucking stand humans.

I need to finish this work first. PoC is working now. Just need to optimize it. I noticed that if you iterate linear coefficients also, while 2d sieving (using many quadratic coefficients), you need to cycle the modulus like every 10 (or 50, or whatever) smooths. You can find all your smooths in one modulus if you limit the scope to linear coefficients that are smaller then p//2. All of this really has my intuition firing off that there has to be a bridge to number field sieve. I'll need to spent a few weeks properly exploring that once this is done. I'll upload the 2d sieving PoC tomorrow. I will need to think how to best get as much advantage out of it as  possible. I know you can cut down on mod inv calculations this way. There's this other idea I'm playing with in my head. If you find a smooth, with a certain factorization, I wonder if we can't just try to find a similar factorization at a different quadratic coefficient. It's just a vague idea in my head right now, I'll need to explore it. I think tomorrow for now, I'll optimize the PoC... see where the biggest bottlenecks still end up being... and then I'll just think if I can solve those bottlenecks with my 2d sieving appraoch. I'm at the end of my rope mentally. I don't even know how I survived 2 years of this. But I don't have much left now. It's not the math... it's everything else in life.

I do like this idea of specifically using 2d sieving to hunt for smooths with similar factorization.. so we can succeed with potentially only a handful of smooths. An approach like that may actually work for big numbers where grinding smooths is very slow...hmm.. its like this weird idea that just popped into my head, but it actually makes a lot of sense to more I think about it.... I'm so depressed. I need to finish this. 

In theory it would work. Just sieve the smallest quadratic coefficient. And then look at the factorization and attempt to find primes with uneven exponents in the other quadratic coefficients. Just this very targeted appraoch to go fishing for smooths. I don't know. I'll mess around with the idea eventually I guess. It definitely could work... 

The more I read about transphobia coming out of the US, which no doubt has a trickledown effect all over the western world... the more I just want to move to China and fight the west from there. There is 0 respect here in the west. Also fuck big tech. Big tech is the most disgusting thing in this fucking world. All I need is one small advancement in my math work, and then it will be easy to arrange a job in China and a visa. I'm going. I don't care anymore. If I get to fight the americans, sign me up. Fucking ruined my life in america. I was a fucking guest in your country and you harass me and point guns at me. Fuck you.
