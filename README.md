I will rewrite the entire PoC this weekend. I've been learning about self-initializing quadratic sieve (using the large prime variation) ... so I am going to use that as a starting point, and begin improving it with my own findings.... I'll upload a reworked version shortly... I'm too stubborn trying to do my own thing, and sometimes its good, but sometimes it also isn't.


Anyway... I know I'm right... and I have a feeling the truth is going to reveal itself very soon... learning about self-initializing QS.. definitely was something I should have done sooner... I don't know why I skipped it and instead looked at number field sieve. But I see it now... and all I need to do now I construct a PoC that out-performs msieve... and it's game over. Watch what will happen.... stupid assholes. 

Really.. this has left me absolutely bitter, and there wont be forgiveness at the end of this. Maybe if microsoft paid my former manager many millions for what they did to him. It's not that they fired him. It's that they fired him by questioning his integrity, all the while, he was the only person in this industry with common sense. He had succeeded in getting me to move to the US. And then Microsoft and everyone else in the US GOV managed to undo that. But we know microsoft isn't going to do the right thing, because they are greed obsessed monsters. I am so absolutely bitter. And yes, I did entertain going to China. But only AFTER you people treated me like complete fucking shit and chased away buyers in Europes with the threat of sanctions. So I would be very careful what you are going to say in the coming months. Because I won't stop here, I'm at the beginning of my math journey, and I have a very clear idea what I want to figure out next. I'm telling you this, because I know the damage that was caused last time you people tried to portray me as a villain.. and I also know that this time, it won't just affect me.. it will affect everyone around me. So be very careful or I promise you, you will have no other options then to kill me to avoid what's coming.
