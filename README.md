Made some more improvements to 2d sieving. The biggest bottleneck right now is constructing the 2d sieve interval.
So it is time now to optimize that. In theory instead of constructing row by row, we should be able to fill out the interval in 2d dimension. Hence having to execute a whole less code.
Additionally this would then be perfect to be further optimized with SIMD I guess.
Let me start optimizing that code.

Because each process is now responsible for a range of quadratic coefficients, the process at index 0 (which has the smallest quadratic coefficient range) will yield the most smooth. Hence I think it is better to move parallelization to the sieving process itself instead.
There is still a lot of work to do with this 2d sieving. But I am feeling extremely optimistic about this approach (it may not seem like it yet, but just wait... you will see soon! I know what I'm doing now). I should also fix the paper soon, so that once the PoC is ready I can make some noise about it. It's definitely wildly different from default SIQS.

Anyway, I'll go for a run. Figure out the math after that to optimize constructing that 2d sieving interval and then tomorrow implement it in code... and then we should slowly start seeing the true strength of this approach. This really should be many times faster then normal SIQS and not even talking about its potential to be optimized further with SIMD.

Actually let me add simd tomorrow with cython. Easy enough. :)

I jsut realized, I really can move all of the linear congruences to the initialization phase of the algorithm, out side of all the loops. Thats the beauty of working with moduli like this. A shitload can just be precomputed. And I really need to start using that as a strength. Then the heavy lifting that remains in the algorithm can be hyper optimized with things such as SIMD. Yea, this is going to be beautiful once its done. I was doing some more reading, I cant find anything similar on the public domain, I did read about lattice sieving in number field sieve, which may be similar but I'm not sure but either way, doing something similar in quadratic sieve is a good thing. I don't think default SIQS could achieve this, because they arn't working with moduli and without that reduction things get complicated very quickly... still... I really want to finish this and move back to a deeper study of some of the stuff I was doing before. It is really infuriating bc I know I am right, I know I am on to something... yet I am completely ignored. I'll wrap this up and start aggressively sharing it online I guess. It's my only hope for a better future. 

Update: Bleh, super low focus day. And tomorrow I want to attempt running marathon distance for the first time in my life. Guess I'll just take a break from work this weekend and resume on monday. If I don't die while attempting a marathon with this heat. You know, I really want to finish this v3 version asap. Hoping to be done by september so I can pivot back to v4... which is really the approach that gets me most excited.. it feels like deep space exploration, pushing off into the unknown... there is something there, a hidden monster lurking beneath the depths... I need to figure it out even if it takes the rest of my life. I don't care anymore if people laugh at my work, I'm not doing this for other people, just because I have to, for myself. I just can't let go of this anymore. It has taken over my life for over 2 years now... and it's just pulling me in more and more... and it's not because of having invested so much already... it's just that the deeper I get, the more I begin to see the outline of something amazing.. and it's still just this vague picture, I have to figure it out, I have to see it. People don't understand this, they all just think I have become psychotic and need to be in a mental hospital or something. Life is too short to waste it on things that don't matter to yourself. I rather end up homeless and broke if it means I can keep working on this. I'll work on this until my last dying breath.

Returning to Europe has been a nightmare. Absolutely nothing for me here. Doesn't even feel like I came back home... just came back to being that highschool dropout who couldn't find a job. Despite all of my achievements. I don't think I'll ever forgive people. In the last year, the only person who tried to help me was Chinese... but I guess I am too paranoid... especially since Europe is now arresting Chinese hackers... perhaps China would just arrest me out of revenge so they try to lure me there. It's just hard to know what is real in this world.. people are very good at deceiving others. And in the large scheme of things and the politics that are played out, a single human life means nothing. Ofcourse then again, I am highly paranoid, and perhaps China is the only place left in the world where talent can actually do anything. They sure seem to be living in the future already while the rest of the world is falling apart.

Anyway.... marathon day today.... guess I'll just stay in zone 2 until I hit 30k. Running 30k wasn't too bad last sunday. After that I can go zone 3, or 4 for the last 12km if my legs allow for it. Guess my plan is to go as slow as I have to, so I can run a marathon every sunday from now on without injuring myself. Once I feel more confident in my body's ability to handle those distances and increased mileage I guess I'll start pushing my time and eventually move into ultra marathon distances. I quite like the idea of just running all day long. Like Forrest Gump.

Ran a marathon today. Right at the start though, a few minutes after I left my house, some idiot shouted "fucking homo". I gave him the middle finger. I think had he stopped, I would have legit killed that man. Like, I am serious. I would have either severely wounded him or killed him. And I realize this is PTSD or something, from what happened in america, getting threatened with a gun. Some days I feel like a weakling that something lame like that fucked with my mental state that much. But I think its all of the things that happened in very quick succession around that time.. all those things together. Had I just been threatened with a gun in isolation... I probably would have just been fine after a couple of months... but microsoft treating my like trash... firing me, losing my work visa, not seeing my friends anymore bc of it... a long time friend dying a few weeks after that gun incident the day after I had dinner with him (he already had health issues.. but still) and then also someone else dying a few months later suddenly.. someone who together with the FBI had tried to find a solution (which sadly didn't work out) ... and then the persistent unemployment and getting treated like this back in europe with 0day buyers getting chased away from me... my head is in a very bad place... oh and ofcourse microsoft also firing my manager... one of the few people in this fucking shit industry who helped me, that caused a lot of grief in addition to all the other trauma. I ran a marathon today bc it's the only way I can keep it together. And next sunday I'll run a marathon again. And then I'll start running ultra marathons. And honestly, I hope during one of my runs I just drop dead. I really hope I just drop dead.

Update: Alright, got some more work done. got it all layed out so that it is ready now to be optimized with SIMD. I'll just do numpy arrays and cython.. if I cant get a considerable improvement over what I already I have, I'll just stop and move to factorization_v4... else I'll keep going here, maybe write it in C, update the paper and spread it on the internet (since nobody seems to care about my work anyway).
