I will rewrite the entire PoC this weekend. I've been learning about self-initializing quadratic sieve (using the large prime variation) ... so I am going to use that as a starting point, and begin improving it with my own findings.... I'll upload a reworked version shortly... I'm too stubborn trying to do my own thing, and sometimes its good, but sometimes it also isn't.


Anyway... I know I'm right... and I have a feeling the truth is going to reveal itself very soon... learning about self-initializing QS.. definitely was something I should have done sooner... I don't know why I skipped it and instead looked at number field sieve. But I see it now... and all I need to do now I construct a PoC that out-performs msieve... and it's game over. Watch what will happen.... stupid assholes. 

Really.. this has left me absolutely bitter, and there wont be forgiveness at the end of this. Maybe if microsoft paid my former manager many millions for what they did to him. It's not that they fired him. It's that they fired him by questioning his integrity, all the while, he was the only person in this industry with common sense. He had succeeded in getting me to move to the US. And then Microsoft and everyone else in the US GOV managed to undo that. But we know microsoft isn't going to do the right thing, because they are greed obsessed monsters. I am so absolutely bitter. And yes, I did entertain going to China. But only AFTER you people treated me like complete fucking shit and chased away buyers in Europes with the threat of sanctions. So I would be very careful what you are going to say in the coming months. Because I won't stop here, I'm at the beginning of my math journey, and I have a very clear idea what I want to figure out next. I'm telling you this, because I know the damage that was caused last time you people tried to portray me as a villain.. and I also know that this time, it won't just affect me.. it will affect everyone around me. So be very careful or I promise you, you will have no other options then to kill me to avoid what's coming.

ps: SIQS seems to solve generating small smooth candidates, which this uploaded PoC attempted to kind of do also, but nowhere near as well as SIQS does... that combined with my findings to construct polynomials... I know I am right. I god damn know I am right. And damn you all for playing me the fool. I hate you people. I absolutely hate you people from the bottom of my heart. When this is over, I am not going to feel happy, I am going to feel endless resentment and hate. I tried assholes. I told everyone I was working on this, and everyone failed to act. I really tried to do the right thing that would result in the best outcome, but you forced me down the worst possible outcome for me... this is going to ruin my life and the life of everyone around me, and if any of these gods you worship is real, then I hope nothing but eternal damnation awaits you people for being this careless.

Update: Cant sleep again. Just extremely depressed. You ever feel so depressed and stressed you feel like throwing up? Yea... thats me constantly lately. 
I know I'm right. I know what's happening. I know what will happen. It would be so easy to just take the coward's way out. But I must finish this now. Until the bitter end. And hope that one day, I can find my focus again and continue my work. Because while this is kind of cool... it's nowhere near what I really want to figure out. It's like a minor distraction, a side-quest... a side-quest with disasterous consequences sadly. I feel extremely alone in this world. Especially right now. I don't know. When you see the world like I do, it is very difficult to stay sane. I think that's why I am always so emotional. I'm not smart, I think I just got brain damage or something that makes me wildly different from normal humans. But it also gives me an outsider perspective on this world... and I don't like what I see. I find the human world deeply disturbing and I feel deeply unsafe in the human world. I would much rather be in the arctic, alone right now. I've often had nightmares about getting murdered by transphobes, because I've seen how hate and jealousy makes people irrational.. I know it's just fear manifesting itself. But with everything that's happening, I feel like I am probably speedrunning that fate right now... while also endangering the people around me. I really hope, that when I die, it is alone and far away from any humans in the arctic snow. There's no malice in nature... in nature I can sleep like a bear, without a care in the world.

Had I been rational, I should have gone to China. Look at the US, when I see the shit politicians say non-stop about trans people, no wonder those things happened in Redmond. These people are insane. They dont dwserve any cryptologic advantage. They will have to kill me bc while they are in office, they are my greatest enemy. They ruined my life. They incited all that harassment. And it saddens me my own country is doing their bidding right now. Deeply dissappointed by belgium. Europe should grow some balls. America is nothing. They are officially a thirs world country now. They are not relevant in this world anymore or to the future of this world.  Fucking transphobes. Ill destroy you people.
