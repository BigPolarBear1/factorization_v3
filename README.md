Note: I know I am right. I know people know I am right. I know how you people treat me, despite being right. I do not care about the reasons. I will not forgive you people for stealing more then a year from my life where I had to struggle like this. I especially wont forgive belgium. I would renounce my citizenship and move elsewhere for this. I cannot ever forgive this. I've been broke for a year, I can't find work, I can't find 0day buyers, I can't see my friends anymore and I'm stuck, there is no dignity in living like this. A human life is very short, and you have wasted a good chunk of mine. There absolutely won't be forgiveness. We're past that now. And if I get the oppurtunity to work in Asia, I will go and there is absolutely nothing that can be changed about that. Because what you people are doing, I have no words for it, this is betrayal. Betrayal to the long career I had, helping find security issues in software like OpenSsl and other very important components.. you better hope this was my last discovery because next time I will remember who treated me like shit and who didn't. Remember that. The only way I may even remotely change my mind is if Microsoft publically apologizes to my former manager and pays him many millions. Without that, forget it, you'll have to kill me I guess.

Update 30 August 2025

Uploaded QSv3_simd.pyx 

To build (from the PoC_Files folder): python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br>
To run: python3 run_qs.py -base 2000 -keysize 150 -debug 0 -lin_size 1 -quad_size -1 </br> (note the actual factor base per quadratic coefficient will be about +/- half of the -base parameter)

note: Only one worker at a time works for now... I need to rework that part.

Improved things some more. Below 30 seconds now to factor 150-bit with one worker. Which is still not good enough. Still a lot of awfull bottlenecking going on. It's definitely faster then what I had before.. because if I would run this with multiple workers (which I need to reimplement first), this shouldn't take more then a few seconds. I wonder if I need to rethink my whole SIMD approach... I should do some testing with like strided writes, to double check I'm actually getting a speed advantage. I guess if we have primes that are larger then the chunk size we actually get a slow down vs strided writes. Ergh. Maybe I need a mixed approach. Let me fix it monday. This shouldn't take more then a second to factor 150-bit. I'll keep optimizing until I achieve that.

I mean, it demonstrates the math already. But let me fix that monday. It's bottleneckig in SIMD_1() right now... but as I'm about to head to sleep bc I need to run 50k tomorrow.. I realized this will actually perform worse for large primes. I need to use strided writes for sure for large primes. Otherwise it's just writing chunks with only zeroes and wasting cpu cycles. That should then fix that bottleneck... and hopefully bring it down to below 20 seconds. Then I need to start optimizing all the other shit.

Oh and ofcourse the linear congruences, those too take up a good chunk of time.. but there is some special trick to make it go really fast (for mod pow).. so I need to implement that. That should then bring it close to 10 seconds. And the rest I can optimize by using things such as typed memory views and adding static typing in general. And that will then hopefully bring it all down to about a second. We'll see next week. Time to die tomorrow (run 50k). Only time I feel free of pain anymore lately. On my long runs, alone in nature. Best shit ever.
