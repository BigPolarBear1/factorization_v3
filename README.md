Update: One thing I must check for sure is, if we pull all smooths from a single modulus. Can we take square roots over the modulus like number field sieve does? .. or find some connection to number field sieve... I will quickly have a look at this next.  Because that could also dramatically reduce the number of required smooths... even if we are forced to work with a single modulus. Remembering last time I messed around with this, not having all my smooths in the same modulus was a headache... this may actually solve it now. Then we have succesfully merged quadratic sieve and number field sieve. So fucking depressed. This fucking last year man. How they treat me. Like I don't see it.  We might actually be able to jump over to number field sieve's approach now... this may actually complete the puzzle now..... yea fuck you all. Go to hell for all you did. Fuck america too. I see your government constantly crying about trans people. I know who is my enemy and who is not. You should respect people. Yea, maybe learn about that you fucking losers. 

Bah, not enough hours in a day. I just can't see why it wouldn't work if we pull al our smooths from one modulus (which we can do now pulling from multiple quadratic coefficients) and just find smooths mod m .... and then at the end we take the square root over mod m. I just need to figure out the details of it. But this should merge number field sieve and quadratic sieve. I'm sure it can be done now. This was what I missed for so long... it's all just connecting in my head now. Like, before when I was struggling trying to get number field's sieve appraoch to work, I coulnd't figure out how to find the correct quadratic coefficient for a square relation... but you can do it if you pull all your smooths from one modulus. Next week, I will spent the entire week bashing my head against this. Then we'll see. Tomorrow I will go run 50k. If I get ran over by a car, or have any sort of accident, I garantuee you it was pete hegseth and his cronies who killed me.

Bah, I actually did some debugging, and found out that you shouldn't use even quadratic coefficients because those will generally yield bad smooths.
Let me optimize the code next. The 2d sieving is working, but it is still wildly unoptimized and we arn't using any tricks yet to gain an advantage there.
