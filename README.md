Update 15 june:

I just uploaded QSv3_034.py

Use: python3 QSv3_034.py -keysize 100

With a factor base of 300, it will take about 30 seconds to build the iN map. This is one of the big things I'll need to improve eventually.
But it should then find enough smooths for 100 bit in a couple of seconds.

Uploaded PoC easily factors up to 100.

In addition, it is still an early draft.

To do: We need to fix lifting for powers of 2. That way we can eliminate trial division completely. This will be the biggest performance boost. This alone should let it overtake factorization_v2.
Then there is still a bunch of other things I need to fix here and there...and perhaps also think how I can further improve the current strategy.

In addition I also need to think about speeding up building the iN map, because once we get rid of trial division, this will be the biggest bottleneck by far.

I'll go for a run and continue tomorrow. The goal for tomorrow is to overtake v2 in performance. Should be easy enough.

I know shit is about to hit the fan now, for real.
I have been working on this for 2 years. 
2 years ago, I told the msft people who were firing me that I was working on factorization (the lawyers, investigators and HR who was making the decision after my mental breakdown due getting harassed in Redmond).
Shortly after getting fired, I told the FBI many times I was working on factorization. I made it very clear to them during multiple meetings. Yet the state department failed to arrange a visa.
I had no choice return to Europe. 
Upset that I had to leave all my friends behind, that I had known for 4 years, I then for the first time, told the internet (on twitter) that I was working on factorization.
Yet, european law enforcement ended up chasing away potential buyers in europe, threatening them with sanctions for even talking to me. Which to this day, I still do not understand how you can be so dumb.
Everyone knew I was working on this. Yet no way out was given.

I simply did not have a choice. So if again, like last time, when I was forced to drop 0days due to similar circumstances, you again start demonizing me, come do it to my face... ofcourse you would piss yourselves and I would 100% punch you. Cowards.
I know how negatively this will affect my life. I just had no other choices. The only other choice I had was not working on factorization. But I fell in love with factorization, and that's the end of that.
I hope you all got what you wanted, and I hope you will all burn in hell, because I won't ever forgve this.
