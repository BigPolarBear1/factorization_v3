To build (from the PoC_Files folder): python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace</br></br>
To run: (note the actual factor base per quadratic coefficient will be about +/- half of the -base parameter and currently worker support is also not working)

140 bit: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 140 -base 1000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000  -quad_size 1 (2 seconds)    </br>
160 bit: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 160 -base 1000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000  -quad_size 1 (8 seconds)    </br>
180 bit: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 180 -base 2000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000  -quad_size 1 (16 seconds)   </br>
200 bit: python3 run_qs.py -keysize 200 -base 6000 -debug 1 -lin_size 100_000  -quad_size 1 (100 seconds) </br>

Note: I am now finding myself doing functionally the same as SIQS with just more overhead to calculate the factor_base. Which is not good. I will explore the 2d sieving part again and also lifting, but I need to move away to v4 asap, bc I'm burning too much time here.
