Update: One thing I must check for sure is, if we pull all smooths from a single modulus. Can we take square roots over the modulus like number field sieve does? .. or find some connection to number field sieve... I will quickly have a look at this next.  Because that could also dramatically reduce the number of required smooths... even if we are forced to work with a single modulus (although I guess we could combine moduli, but being able to find smooths from one moduli and also track the quadratic coefficients might enable me to figure out the details of the math now). Remembering last time I messed around with this, not having all my smooths in the same modulus was a headache... this may actually solve it now. Then we have succesfully merged quadratic sieve and number field sieve. So fucking depressed. This fucking last year man. How they treat me. Like I don't see it.  We might actually be able to jump over to number field sieve's approach now... this may actually complete the puzzle now..... yea fuck you all. Go to hell for all you did. Fuck america too. I see your government constantly crying about trans people. I know who is my enemy and who is not. You should respect people. Yea, maybe learn about that you fucking losers. 

Bah, not enough hours in a day. I just can't see why it wouldn't work if we pull al our smooths from one modulus (which we can do now pulling from multiple quadratic coefficients) and just find smooths mod m .... and then at the end we take the square root over mod m. I just need to figure out the details of it. But this should merge number field sieve and quadratic sieve. I'm sure it can be done now. This was what I missed for so long... it's all just connecting in my head now. Like, before when I was struggling trying to get number field's sieve appraoch to work, I coulnd't figure out how to find the correct quadratic coefficient for a square relation... but you can do it if you pull all your smooths from one modulus. Next week, I will spent the entire week bashing my head against this. Then we'll see. Tomorrow I will go run 50k. If I get ran over by a car, or have any sort of accident, I garantuee you it was pete hegseth and his cronies who killed me. 

Note: In case of getting murdered by the americans, in the current PoC, the higher the quad_sieve_size and lin_sieve_size, the more smooths it will be able to pull from a single modulus. Oh and if you want to test on small numbers, you need to make sure that your interval and log values are but signed ints (you need to change that) otherwise that threshold value will be negative and converted to unsigned. And change too_close to 1 and that other parameter too (the lower bound siqs thing). Then you can get it set up to run on small numbers and pull from a single modulus... and get that number field sieve shit figured out. Because it shouldn't be too hard. It's all there already. All the math. Everything. Good luck in case something bad happens.
