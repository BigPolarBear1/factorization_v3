This one massively improves the building of the iN map. Even for a factor base of 1000, it takes only a few seconds. 
Also sped up the lifting code a little by using a faster root finding method.

I am busy refactoring all the logic within the find_smooth function. I'll probably upload it somewhere the week of the 21st of July. 
I'm working on creating a single hashmap for each iN value (quadratic coefficient) which we can then use to basically build smooths. 
It's a little complicated to do it in an algorithmically sound way so I've spent the last week going over multiple iterations of refactoring.. but I think its nearly ready now, or atleast I have narrowed down the best way to do it now.

Important: The real strength of this iteration is that we can basically precalculate much of it and just have it sitting on a disk. Then pull from disk and load into RAM the solutions depending on the integer you are factoring (solutions mod p<sup>a</sup><sub>i</sub>). That is the real strength. That is why this way of doing it has a shot at RSA-1024 if you are well funded. When I port everything to c++ I will also write a worker that you can run independatly that will construct a database on disk.. so many steps of the algorithm can be skipped by just pulling what you need from disk. I have no choice but to go the entire mile, until the bitter end... even though I know I have won already, I still cannot find employment and I am still treated as a pariah. So be it. I will go after rsa-1024, I will go until the bitter end. You people just want to buy time, and perhaps you are also hoping that I will end my life out of desperation. I hate all of you.

I know shit is about to hit the fan now, for real.
I have been working on this for 2 years. 
2 years ago, I told the msft people who were firing me that I was working on factorization (the lawyers, investigators and HR who was making the decision after my mental breakdown due getting harassed in Redmond).
Shortly after getting fired, I told the FBI many times I was working on factorization. I made it very clear to them during multiple meetings. Yet the state department failed to arrange a visa.
I had no choice return to Europe. 
Upset that I had to leave all my friends behind, that I had known for 4 years, I then for the first time, told the internet (on twitter) that I was working on factorization.
Yet, european law enforcement ended up chasing away potential buyers in europe, threatening them with sanctions for even talking to me. Which to this day, I still do not understand how you can be so dumb.
Everyone knew I was working on this. Yet no way out was given.

I simply did not have a choice. So if again, like last time, when I was forced to drop 0days due to similar circumstances, you again start demonizing me, come do it to my face... ofcourse you would piss yourselves and I would 100% punch you. Cowards.
I know how negatively this will affect my life. I just had no other choices. The only other choice I had was not working on factorization. But I fell in love with factorization, and that's the end of that.
I hope you all got what you wanted, and I hope you will all burn in hell, because I won't ever forgve this.

I know exactly what is going on. And no, nobody has told me anything, so don't get any ideas on that front, because if you go after anyone I know, you will pay, I promise you that.... I know what is going on for the same reason I know everything else. Figure it out. You people just do not seem to understand. I may have sealed my own fate, but so have all of you, by yet again treating me as a dangerous 0day dropping lunatic, who you are so eager to portray as some type of cyber-terrorist... despite all of the hard work I have done in the past, finding very serious bugs in software like secure channel and OpenSsl... after all that, this is what you people default to. I know why, I know politicians, the intel community and the tech industry absolutely despises people like me... this is why everything happened, that has happened. This is why I ended up dropping 0days in the past. This is why people fired the one person in this industry who actually helped me. Some things never change. You people sealed your own fate. You had so many chances, yet you stubbornly chose to go down this road. It is to late, and we're past the point now that things can ever be forgiven. 

Anyway, I need to finish this. Figure out a way to keep doing this fulltime. This will work... but I have this nagging feeling that this isn't what I'm "supposed" to do. There is something really deep and important here and I still can only see its shape vaguely. I really need a couple of months to just read books, study, and go back to doing "pure research"... mess around with quadratic reciprocity again, things like that... I can't describe what I am looking for, but I know I need to do it. I hope I will be alive long enough to succeed, because I know how this world works. I mean, look at all these idiots always crying about transgender people. Do you think in a world with people like that, anything good is ever going to come to someone like me? Hell, I feel bad for everyone around me. People are insane. I deeply regret how this will impact those around me. I do not wish to be around people. I hate everything about humans and the human world. I just need to do my work and finish what I'm supposed to do. I cannot explain it, but I have to succeed at any cost. And damned be those who try to get in my way.

ps: I just saw that msft downgraded the severity of atleast one of my bugs retroactively. They are now saying my IKE rce bug, which was multiple bugs bundled together, one of which was a stack buffer overrun with control over size and contents which could be triggered remotely pre-auth which they have now labeled as info-disclosure lol. Fucking amateurs. So mad that I was better then all of them together. 0 skills. Don't ever cross my path. This is warning. I will end you people. Its funny bc had any of you idiot tech bros found that bug you would have advertised it as critical, since it has all the critera for it being a remote stack buffer overrun. You people dont know what you're doing. Incompetence. Yes, some of those bugs it was bundled with was OOB read. But the deepest bug was a stack buffer overrun if you matched a certain predefined vendor_id (0patch blog mentioned some bug in the vendor_id parsing itself, but the actual rce bug was much deeper in the logic for a specific vendor id). Fucking infosec losers. My whole career, and especially at msft, constantly trying their best to downplay everything I did.

Msft has been retroactively downplaying my work. They fired my manager claiming he gave me promotions for no reason. My manager, the person who in 2019 came all the way to Belgium to be my friend while all the other infosec assholes were too busy pointing fingers on twitter bc I dropped 0days and who had worked for that company for 27 years. Who was also a navy veteran. The only fucking person in this entire shit industry with balls. You went after him while at the same time rewriting history. If there is any justice in this world, do not let microsoft get away with this. They knew what they were doing. I promise you that. It's a culture of incompetence and laziness, a tech aristocracy too busy peacocking and going after anyone they feel threatened by. Why should they be allowed to so casually ruin the lifes of people? Don't give me a l1 visa if you just intend to threaten me with a gun in redmond and kick me back out. They knew what they were doing, and I want justice for what they did to my manager. Even if I were to die tomorrow, or next week, I would still want justice. Without justice there cant ever be peace, I will haunt them from beyond the grave if I must.

Anyway, I know nobody has the balls to do anything about microsoft. Half these americans are too busy trying to portray me as incompetent and the other half is probably to busy trying to figure out how to portray me as the anti-christ because I'm transgender and know how to find security issues. Two years have gone by, I cant work anymore because of all the trauma microsoft caused, I struggle with insomnia, stay awake at night, reliving getting a chased by some stranger with a gun in Redmond, thinking about what microsoft did to the one person in this industry who ever made the effort to actually help me and be a friend. I havnt seen any of my friends anymore in over a year (friends like my former teamleader). For 2 years my life has been a nightmare. Why does a company get to ruin lifes like this so carelessly? Why doesn't anyone do anything? I will see justice, even if it means trying to succeed with my math until the bitter end, even it it takes me another 20 years. I wont ever stop. 

And for sure the fbi isn't going to do anything. They are best buddies with microsoft and they are also full of shit. Don't say all this shit about getting me a visa and whatnot if you cant pull it off. Just bullshit and a waste of time. I should have tried harder to just find my way back to Canada when I was still in the PNW during my final months there instead of believing these assholes at the fbi could do anything. They problem with feds is that they are just bullshit. They see bullshit as a means to ahieve an end. Nothing more. Atleast my manager always did what he said he was going to do. Literally, my manager was the only good american I have ever known. I hate all other americans. Go to hell.
