My mood just crashed really hard. I might just end it. Just tired. Nothing is happening. All the traffic I keep seeing, it's just stalkers making fun of me. That's all it is. 
Like they were all jealous of my CVEs and now they can come see how I've fallen and laugh at me to feel better about their own shit life. 
Just this fucking shit world. I'm so tired.

I keep thinking, I just got to fix this PoC. Because bunding P+Q into the linear coefficient of a quadratic, it seems quite smart... and it seems like it would improve on multiple polynomial quadratic sieve... I think it would probably run better and longer before running out of steam. But then again, maybe I'm just running around my own tail. Doing shit that's basically to same to whats alraedy out there. If this was novel, I would know by now, someone would have told me. There is no way there would be so me grand conspiracy to silenlty get rid of 1024-bit RSA keys before the Russians and Chinese catch on. Shit like that only happens in movies or books, not in real life. Maybe I am suffering from psychotic symptoms. Just falling deeper into delusions. It's hard to know. There's nothing left anymore in my life. You know, hang out with my former teamlead in Vancouver and all the other friends I had there... for once in my life, everything was perfect. For a little while, I was really happy. I just cant get over all the devastation anymore. So much has been taken away. And there is nothing left. Persistent unemployment. Nobody will even consider me for a job. I don't even get interviews. I'm stuck in life. It's over. Who am I even kidding anymore. Bye.
